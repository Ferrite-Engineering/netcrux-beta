# VexRiscv — captured source fixture

A real, MIT-licensed, **hierarchical** RISC-V core, committed as RTL source
for opening and rendering in NetCrux. It complements the (flat) `picorv32`
fixture: VexRiscv elaborates to a 3-module hierarchy — `VexRiscv` (the
pipeline) instantiating `DataCache` and `InstructionCache` — so it exercises
the hierarchy browser, per-scope layout, and the multi-scope layout cache at
real scale, not just one dense flat module. The 3-module structure is
verified automatically (Yosys-free) by the golden sweep — see
`vexriscv.netlist.json.gz` below.

This is the **`Full`** configuration (caches + M extension + …). Bigger than
picorv32: ~1 980 cells total.

## Upstream

- **Source project:** VexRiscv — a 32-bit RISC-V CPU implemented in SpinalHDL.
- **Generator:** the committed Verilog is the SpinalHDL-generated `VexRiscv_Full.v`
  from the LiteX data package, which commits pre-generated VexRiscv cores so
  downstreams don't need a Scala/SpinalHDL toolchain.
- **Distribution repo:** https://github.com/litex-hub/pythondata-cpu-vexriscv
  (`pythondata_cpu_vexriscv/verilog/VexRiscv_Full.v`).
- **Pinned commit (distribution):** `642ecfed1c84460555d6d803d660cc60cfc1ecb6`.
- **Generator provenance (from the file header):** SpinalHDL v1.9.4
  (git head `270018552577f3bb8e5339ee2583c9c22d324215`); VexRiscv git hash
  `8542a5786b26857f3ef830ae9e72eec031df42d3`.
- **License:** MIT (SPDX: `MIT`) — on the suite allow-list. Copyright (c) 2016
  Spinal HDL contributors. The MIT permission notice is reproduced below
  because the generated Verilog carries no header notice of its own; it must
  travel with this fixture.

## `vexriscv.v` (source)

- **Acquired:** `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litex-hub/pythondata-cpu-vexriscv/642ecfed1c84460555d6d803d660cc60cfc1ecb6/pythondata_cpu_vexriscv/verilog/VexRiscv_Full.v` (committed byte-identical).
- **sha256:** `1ee38dc4b0f3a2ce08de9df1f8e2bb8fceb628a89adb7f624f38ae44cebe9fcc`
- **Modules:** `VexRiscv` (top, ~1 463 cells), `DataCache` (~404 cells),
  `InstructionCache` (~115 cells); ~1 980 cells flattened. Yosys-internal cell
  types (`$mux`, `$dff`, `$eq`, `$add`, `$pmux`, …).
- **Opening it in NetCrux:**
  - `netcrux test/fixtures/netlist/vexriscv/captured/vexriscv.v` (or File →
    Open Source Files…). NetCrux's loose-source flow runs
    `hierarchy -check -auto-top`, which cleanly auto-selects **`VexRiscv`** as
    the top (the only un-instantiated module — no project/top pin needed,
    unlike picorv32). Expand the hierarchy to navigate into the `DataCache` /
    `InstructionCache` scopes; the `VexRiscv` scope is the dense ~1 463-cell
    pipeline.
- **Requires:** Yosys on PATH (Verilog only, no ghdl plugin) — for opening it
  live in NetCrux. The automated test below is Yosys-free.

## `vexriscv.netlist.json.gz` (golden sweep companion)

- Elaborated once via `yosys -q -p "read_verilog vexriscv.v; hierarchy -check
  -auto-top; proc; write_json vexriscv.netlist.json"` (the same auto-top flow
  NetCrux's loose-source open uses), then gzipped.
- Auto-discovered by `test/services/yosys/netlist_golden_test.dart` (WS2), the
  same Yosys-free sweep that covers `picorv32`: parses the committed JSON with
  the production `StreamingYosysJsonReader` and diffs a `NetlistGolden`
  against the committed `vexriscv.expected_netlist.json` (per-module cell /
  port / net counts + cell-type histogram for `VexRiscv` / `DataCache` /
  `InstructionCache`). This is what makes the 3-module hierarchy claim above a
  regression-tested fact rather than a doc assertion — no Yosys spawn needed
  in CI.
- Refresh after changing the source: `REGENERATE=1 flutter test
  test/services/yosys/netlist_golden_test.dart`, then re-gzip
  `vexriscv.netlist.json` and delete the uncompressed copy (see
  `test/fixtures/netlist/helpers/README.md`).
